needed to modify my DSAQueue class to include method:
needed to modify my DSALinkedList to include method:
created menu but then realized graph was of static size so insert did not work (out of bounds)

+edges and vertices were of array type but had to change to linkdelist to make it dynamic size to accomodate adding vertices

please note that in your Graph class you are trying to remove the last element of the list in dfs method, 
but DSALinkedList does not support it, so we need to modify the DSALinkedList class to support the removeLast 
operation too.
